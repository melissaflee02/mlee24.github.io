Just here practicing web development :)

v2 was built using react and gh-pages.  I followed the tutorial [here](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f).  

Here are some useful commands for developing:
* `npm run start` for starting the local server
* `npm run deploy` to deploy to gh-pages

### Past versions:
* [v1](https://melissaflee02.github.io/archive/v1/)
* [current](https://melissaflee02.github.io/)

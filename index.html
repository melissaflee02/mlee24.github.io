  <h1>Hi, I'm Melissa</h1>
  <h2>What I do for Work</h2>
  <p>I'm a freshman at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Economics! I am an intern at <a href="https://www.cheapreats.com/">CheaprEats</a>, working in backend software development to process User and Vendor Analytics with GraphQL and Javascript.</p>
  <h2>What I do for Enjoyment</h2>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy pursuing independing coding projects to solve real-world challenges. Checkout my <a href="https://github.com/melissaflee02/Catan">Github</a> to see my latest project programming Java servlets to host an online multiplayer Settlers of Catan board game!
  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>Having struggled with social interaction at a young age, I am passionate about leveraging technology to advance the human interaction model. In pursuit of this goal, I envision an Artificial Intelligence bot that can facilitate, and engage in, healthy human interaction.
  <br><br>
  Outside of engineering, working, and school, I am a spikeball-enthusiast, aspiring chef, and an <a href="https://www.svvoice.com/fremonts-melissa-lee-rockstar-in-the-classroom-and-all-star-in-the-ring/">internationally-ranked wrestler</a>!
